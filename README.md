# guacamole-extras
The intent of this repository is to store code that extends the Guacamole
application, primarily through extensions, that is not included in the default
code base.  There are a variety of reasons why items may not be included in
the mainline code, but these are items that I've found useful in various
use-cases for Guacamole and that I'd like to share with the community.

Feel free to download, compile, modify, fork, and contribute to this
repository - I certainly don't have any desire to keep this all to myself
or develop it exclusively, and welcome any contributions!
